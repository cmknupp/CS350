SNHU CS350 coursework - Emerging Sys Arch and Tech

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to develop a prototype of a smart thermastat for a home heating embedded system.  The 
system should check for button presses to change the set temperature every 200ms.  It should also check
the ambient temperature and compare it to the set temperature every 300ms, turning the heating element on 
or off as needed and indicating when the heat is one with a red LED. The final requirement was to output system 
status information in a specified format via wireless connect to the company servers.  

What did you do particularly well?
I did create a task manager that checked all tasks at the specified  intervals.  I think I commented the code 
well so that others could maintain it over time.  

Where could you improve?
I could improve the reflection, my reflection was overly technical.  This was a result of my lack of confidence 
(experience) creating embedded systems for real devices. I am not sure I am able to decide what projects require
different specifications on the available MCUs.  

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I appreciated the public forum on TI's website and have added that to my list of resources to explore when
I need additional information on a topic.  

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This project really helped me understand how to read the spec sheets and starter code with the MCU and understand how 
the files can be modified to be used in a specific project. Developing that skill will help with future projects, 
both those using embedded systems and those that do not.  It is a widely applicable skill for this field. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Good commenting, descriptive variable names, and avoiding hardcoding any numbers into functions. This allows for changing
variables or functions in the future with ease.
